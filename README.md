## Exploratory Data Analysis

Run the "Data Cleaning and Exploration-Team 3.4.ipynb" notebook first to create the final_crimes.csv file which is required for every other notebook as they each contain a machine learning algorithm.

## Regression

My notebook has a couple linear regression algorithms which predict the number of crimes and arrests per month respectively.

## Classification

My team members' notebooks each have one of the following classification algorithms that predicts whether a perpetrator got arrested or not.

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* K-Nearest Neighbors
